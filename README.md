## Planetary FPS Controller

**File:** `FPSphere.cs`  
This script implements a **custom first-person controller** designed for movement on a **spherical planet**.  
It replaces Unity’s default gravity with a **custom directional gravity system** that aligns the player to the planet’s surface.  

### Key Features
- Calculates gravity direction based on the player’s position relative to the planet center.  
- Uses **quaternions** and **Euler rotations** for smooth orientation and camera alignment.  
- Supports **walking and running** speeds via adjustable input parameters.  
- Includes **roll correction** and camera stabilization for a natural planetary feel.
